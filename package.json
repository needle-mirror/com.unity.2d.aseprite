    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added a new import mode, Tile Set, which imports tile data from Aseprite and generates Unity Tilemap assets on import.\n- Added support for a parameter in the generated animation events.\n- Added a choice on how Animation Events are stored, as individual events or grouped up and listened through `OnAnimationEvent(string)`.\n\n### Fixed\n- Reduced the font size slightly in the importer headers to match other inspector headers in Unity. (DANB-644)\n- Fixed an issue where the Sort Order would not be reset in Animation Clips when making use of the Z-index in Aseprite.\n- Fixed an issue where SpriteRenderers would lose their reference if an Aseprite file's name was changed. (DANB-692)\n- Fixed an issue where adding Sprite Bones would cause the Sprites to become corrupt in the importation. (DANB-779)\n- Fixed an issue where the sprite rect would not get updated after being set in the Sprite Editor.\n- Fixed an issue where the references to sprites would be lost when adding new layers to an Aseprite file. (DANB-782)"
